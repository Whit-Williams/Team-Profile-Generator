# Team Profile Generator

Welcome to The Team Profile Generator App.

Following on from our lesson on Object Oriented Programming, I have created a Team Profile generator using npm Inquirer and Node.js.

## About The Project

The task for this challenge was to build an application that allows a team manager to generate a html page that displays their team's employee details. The employee details are created by answering questions prompted by Inquirer using the command line. Once the file is generated it is then saved to a folder called "output".
